        Hi, I'm Prajula â€” a food lover who enjoys simple, tasty meals without
        spending hours in the kitchen. I created this space for anyone who

        stress! Every recipe here is built on clean ingredients, minimal steps,
        and maximum taste. Whether you're a beginner or just too busy, you're in
        the right place. Letâ€™s make lazy cooking a lifestyle.
