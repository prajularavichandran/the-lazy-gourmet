    <h1>👋 About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I’m Prajula — a passionate food lover who enjoys the flavors more than the fuss!

While I truly appreciate good food, I’m not someone who loves spending hours in the kitchen. I believe in the beauty of simple ingredients, clean cooking, and making meals that are both tasty and time-friendly.

Over the years, I’ve noticed that “simple” often gets mistaken for “boring” — but that doesn’t have to be the case. That’s why I created this space:
To bring together recipes that are quick, clean, flavourful, and fun — for anyone who shares the same food values as I do.</p>

<h1>🥗 What You’ll Find Here</h1>
<p>This website is a curated collection of dishes I genuinely love and make regularly. You won’t find over-complicated techniques or long grocery lists here. Instead, expect:

Recipes with minimal ingredients and maximum taste

Dishes that feel close to their roots, without being fussy

Food that is simple, soulful, and satisfying

Cooking that feels more like play than pressure</p>

<h1>✨ Why I Do This</h1>
<p>Because I believe simplicity is the best policy — and that applies to life and cooking. Good food doesn't have to be complicated to be delicious.

So take a look around, try a dish or two, and most importantly — enjoy the process.

Happy cooking!
— Prajula 🌿</p>
